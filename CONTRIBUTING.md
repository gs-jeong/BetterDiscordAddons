# How to Contribute

Contributing for this repo is pretty laid back. All contributions should come from your own fork. Try to stick to the same style shown in the repo. Make your changes to the source files under `src` and not the built files under `Plugins`. Don't increment the version numbers without pre-approval.

## Contributor Agreement

By contributing, you agree that all rights to the project and the contribution will be retained by the repo owner. Additionally, you agree that your contribution will be published and distributed by the same license seen in the LICENSE file in the repo.
